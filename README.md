# NewsFeed-MEAN-Stack-App
Implemented a basic News Feed App where users can search and read news and admin can post news separately. Angular5: Implemented search pipe that narrows the current list as you type and written unit test in Angular to verify. NodeJS/ExpressJS/MongoDB: Implemented backend to store the news entries and invoke the service from the frontend to fill the interface. Newsfeed page admin can post/update new data into the database.
